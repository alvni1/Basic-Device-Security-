<h1>Basic Device Security</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project consisted of configuring passwords on the command line interface (CLI) to prevent unauthorized users from making any changes on devices in the network, such as the router and the switch. Various password commands were used to create a simple plaintext password, create an encrypted password for stronger protection, and to encrypt the passwords when shown in the configuration. 

Cisco devices often serve as gateways or core components in a network. A breach in their security could expose the entire network to attacks, such as data theft, malware injection, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Password protection on Cisco devices is vital to prevent unauthorized access, safeguard sensitive configurations, and protect against security breaches that could compromise the entire network. It helps maintain device integrity, mitigate internal threats, and comply with security regulations. By limiting access to critical information and enabling layered security measures, such as role-based access control and encryption, password protection ensures the reliability and security of network operations.
